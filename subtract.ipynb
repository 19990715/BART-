The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles, to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, prior to the pandemic, had expanded to record levels. And now the U.S. Healthcare industry is mobilizing to improve COVID-19 testing, treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products and services and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would not have recently completed a 10-year expansion phase before the coronavirus hit, and capital would not be flooding into the country. A couple of statistics should help illustrate our point. Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but nearly $22 trillion in 2019. That's growth of 22-times. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has grown less than 3-times during that time span, to 320 million from 120 million. The delta between GDP growth and population growth has been driven in large part by innovation. In addition, the value of listed corporations on U.S. stock exchanges at the end of 2018 was approximately $32 trillion, representing 41% of global equity market capitalization, while U.S. GDP represented only 25% of global GDP.\", 'We have published our latest version of the Argus Millennial Generation portfolio.

Yet the U.S. economy, prior to the pandemic, had expanded to record levels. And now the U.S. Healthcare industry is mobilizing to improve COVID-19 testing, treatments and, ultimately, a vaccine. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products and services and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would not have recently completed a 10-year expansion phase before the coronavirus hit, and capital would not be flooding into the country. A couple of statistics should help illustrate our point. Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but nearly $22 trillion in 2019. That's growth of 22-times. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has grown less than 3-times during that time span, to 320 million from 120 million. The delta between GDP growth and population growth has been driven in large part by innovation.

We anticipate a pick-up in economic growth in 2021, due in part to aggressive government spending.', \"The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles, to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, prior to the pandemic, had expanded to record levels. And now, the U.S. Healthcare industry is mobilizing to improve COVID-19 testing, treatments and vaccines. Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but nearly $22 trillion at the end of 2019. That's growth of 22-times. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has grown less than 3-times during that time span, to 320 million from 120 million. The delta between GDP growth and population growth has been driven in large part by innovation. In addition, the value of listed corporations on U.S. stock exchanges at the end of 2020 was approximately $32 trillion, representing 41% of global equity market capitalization, while U.S. GDP represented only 25% of global GDP. The current low level of interest rates (the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yield is 1.1%) and the relatively high level of the dollar both attest to the confidence that global investors have in the innovative U.S. economy.\", 'There are now more than 80 million Millennials, born between 1982 and 2000 and ranging in age from their early 20s to their late-30s. This generation is the largest in history - bigger than even the Baby Boomers. Yet despite their size, and according to our research, Millennials currently account for 25% of total U.S income - some $3.1 trillion in direct annual purchasing power. Millennials are already coveted by marketers, even though their annual average income is 40% below the spending levels of the generation ahead of them (Gen X) and 30% below the spending levels of Baby Boomers, who are slowing down. But as Millennials rise into their peak earning years, their earnings are expected to grow.', 'Apple manufactures smartphones, tablets, PCs, software and peripherals for a worldwide customer base.

This was in line with the previous estimates and with the consensus outlook, and represented a sharp spike higher from the 31.4% plunge in 2Q. The GDP report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index. This index, excluding food and energy, rose at a 3.4% pace, well ahead the Federal Reserve\\'s inflation target of 2.0% (though the Fed has said it will allow inflation to run hot for a while before raising short-term interest rates). After this reading, we expect that GDP reports going forward should settle into a low- to mid-single-digits rate. But there is still work to be done. At $21.2 trillion, the U.S. economy at the end of 3Q was almost 3% below its pre-pandemic highs. Some segments of the economy are back to or above pre-pandemic highs. These segments consumer spending on durable and nondurable goods, and investment into residential and intellectual property products. Other segments continue to lag, such as consumer spending on services and investment into equipment.', 'Smaller stocks had another good day on Tuesday, with the Russell 2000 (IWM) jumping 2.5% and the S&P 600 Small Cap (SML) vaulting 2.6%.

Over the long term, we expect the Tech sector to benefit from pervasive digitization across the economy, greater acceptance of transformative technologies, and the development of the Internet of Things (IoT): Healthy company and sector fundamentals are also positive. For individual companies, these include high cash levels, low debt, and broad international business exposure.

In January, BlackRock CEO Lawrence Fink, who oversees approximately $7 trillion in assets, announced that his firm would be investing in companies that are making progress on sustainability. Mr. Fink\\'s new focus follows rapid growth in sustainable assets in recent years. According to Opimas, a management consultancy focused on global capital markets, global assets under management in ESG strategies had grown to $40.5 trillion in 2020, doubling in four years and tripling in eight years. There were almost 400 ESG strategies launched in the Morningstar investment universe in 2019, compared with around 160 launches in 2016.  The UN Principles for Responsible Investing -- to which Argus Research is a signatory -- now represents more than 1,750 signatories with assets of US $80 trillion, according to Barron\\'s. As assets have flowed in, SRI investing has evolved over the past 40 years.  Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all businesses that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as workers\\' rights, poverty, hunger and the climate. Based on numerous requests from clients, we have compiled a list of companies followed by Argus Research that are in position to have this type of \"sustainable impact\" on the environment, workplace and community.  These firms have exemplary records not only in delivering on the bottom line, but also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for their employees. We derived our list by identifying companies that are either BUY-rated or HOLD-rated by Argus analysts, and also score highly on ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria established by the JUST Capital Foundation. JUST Capital utilizes a combination of polling, data-driven research, and strategic engagement to shift behaviors and activities in corporate America and the financial markets. JUST Capital\\'s mission is to drive measurable corporate change to create a stakeholder-centric, inclusive form of capitalism that reflects the priorities of the American public.  JUST ranks the Russell 1000 on these criteria against a scale of 1-100. Here are the companies in the Argus Universe that score highest on the scale.
